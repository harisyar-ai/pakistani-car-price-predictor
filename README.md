## Why This Project Matters
Car prices in Pakistan fluctuate heavily due to currency rates, import policy changes, dealership margins, and city-wise demand differences. Buyers and sellers often rely on guesswork or outdated references.

This project introduces a **data-driven, transparent, and standardized valuation system** using real market data and machine learning.

**Key problems solved**  
- Inconsistent pricing across cities and dealers  
- Manual estimation errors  
- Lack of reliable online valuation tools  
- Difficulty comparing similar vehicles  

**Who benefits**  
- Individual buyers & sellers  
- Dealerships and showrooms  
- Students/researchers studying pricing dynamics  
- Developers building valuation APIs

## Project Overview
A complete end-to-end ML pipeline that predicts current market prices with **97.48% R²** and **±218,340 PKR** average error.  
Final model: **LightGBM** with full preprocessing pipeline, deployed via Streamlit.

---
## Dataset Description
Over **5,000 real listings** scraped in 2025 from PakWheels.com and verified local dealerships (Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, etc.).

### Raw → Cleaned → Engineered
- Removed duplicates, outliers, typos
- Standardized brand/model names and units
- Created **19 powerful features** from 9 raw columns

**Key Engineered Features**  
- Vehicle age & mileage per year  
- Log-scaled mileage  
- Brand tier (Premium / Mid-range / Budget)  
- Popular model flags (Corolla, Civic, Fortuner, etc.)  
- Hybrid/EV premium  
- Imported vs local flag  
- Automatic transmission  
- City price premium (Lahore/Karachi/Islamabad)

## Run Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/harisyar-ai/pakistani-car-price-predictor.git
cd pakistani-car-price-predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run car_price_prediction/app/streamlit_app.py

## Future Improvements

- Integrate more data sources (OLX, local dealers API)
- Add time-series trend analysis
